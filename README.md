# ButtonsGridExample
An example to learn how to add dynamically button images to a grid

Here I'm creating some random button images and by pressing them showing some internal information about them. 

I've created: 
- HUD
- PAWN
- GameMode 
- Some Widget BP classes: 
  - HUD_Start ( created from myHUD )
  - UI_Button ( a canvas with a button with image inherited )
  - UI_ButtonsGridPanel ( a canvas with a grid panel to insert our dynamic items, alias slots )
